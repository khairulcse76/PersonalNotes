  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/logos/
    - assets/images/
    - android/app/src/main/res/drawable/noteslogo.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Ubuntu
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu/Ubuntu-Regular.ttf
  #      - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu/Ubuntu-Medium.ttf
  #      - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu/Ubuntu-LightItalic.ttf
  #      - asset: assets/fonts/ubuntu/Ubuntu-Bold.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
